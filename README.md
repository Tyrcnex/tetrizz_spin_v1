# tetrizz_spin source

hi, i made tetrizz_spin. it's a tetrio bot. invite it by friending tetrizz_spin on tetrio and inviting like u would with mochbot. it was originally supposed to be a bot that tries to maximize spin efficiency (e.g. b2b/bag), but i guess theres more potential for this bot (maximized efficiency is pretty easy anyways, just do single spins all the time)

i have some very questionable program stuff in here (i think spawning a child process every time a move is requested is... kind of bad?). feel free to judge me, send me a dm in discord (@tyrcnex) or friend me on tetrio (@chadhary_12345)

## todo

- gen alpha dialogue :tf:
- \[ambitious\] cheese race simulator? sends arbitrary garbage with undo in practice mode
- ppo-like RL training? idk
- use triangle.js new adapter thing
- better chat system (more commands, possibly other stuff like chat minigames or special event handling like for chesstris events)
- and of course, V2!

p.s. run commands with %help in chat
